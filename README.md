## üíñ Thyroid Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìö Project Overview

This project aims to predict thyroid disease using the Random Forest machine learning model. The dataset includes various features relevant to thyroid conditions, including demographic factors, medical history, and clinical examination results.

## üìä Dataset

We use a dataset that includes the following medical attributes:

- **Age**: The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis or treatment.
- **Gender**: The gender of the patient (male or female).
- **Smoking**: Whether the patient is a smoker or not.
- **Hx Smoking**: Smoking history of the patient (e.g., whether they have ever smoked).
- **Hx Radiotherapy**: History of radiotherapy treatment for any condition.
- **Thyroid Function**: The status of thyroid function, possibly indicating if there are any abnormalities.
- **Physical Examination**: Findings from a physical examination of the patient, which may include palpation of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures.
- **Adenopathy**: Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.
- **Pathology**: Specific types of thyroid cancer as determined by pathology examination of biopsy samples.
- **Focality**: Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).
- **Risk**: The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type.
- **T**: Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.
- **N**: Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.
- **M**: Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.
- **Stage**: The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.
- **Response**: Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment.
- **Recurred**: Indicates whether the cancer has recurred after initial treatment.


## üîç Cross-Validation

We use cross-validation to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our models. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple subsets and training/testing the model on different combinations of these subsets. This helps to mitigate overfitting and provides a better estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

## üéØ Hyperparameter Tuning

We perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of our machine learning models. This process involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters for each model by using techniques such as grid search or random search. Hyperparameter tuning helps in improving the model's accuracy and overall performance.


## üìä Evaluation Metrics

We use the following evaluation metrics to assess model performance:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted outcomes.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## üìâ Learning Curves

Learning curves visualize the model's performance over training iterations:
- **Training Curve**: Plots the model's performance on the training data over successive training batches or epochs.
- **Validation Curve**: Shows how well the model generalizes to unseen data during training.
